			<h1>DATS 6401 - Project 2 - Parisa Nazarijam</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>My plan for this project starts with reviewing and visualizing data on the global immigrants including 
			refugees and asylum seekers based on demographics such as(population, country of birth, age, occupation,
			marital status),type and class of their admission (immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, family-sponsored preferences,
			employment-based preferences, diversity, refugees and asylum seekers). For this project, I referred to several sources 
			such as The World Bank, UNICEF, United Nation, Homeland Security, and Migration Policy Institute. 
			The data presents the estimates of international migrant by age, sex, and their origin from 2010 
			to 2017 and are available for 30 countries, which have the highest immigration rate.
